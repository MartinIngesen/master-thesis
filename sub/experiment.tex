The following chapter introduces the actual implementation of the experiment based on the methodology presented in Chapter 4. The collection of the data set, the software versions, the hardware
specifications and the used algorithms during the experiment are presented as well as the experimental design and the technical implementation. It demonstrates the technical execution of the
methodology for reproducibility of the use case.

\section{Software Specifications}
\label{sec:softwarespecs}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS Released February 2020.
    \item go version go1.13.3 linux/amd64, released October 2019.
    \item Perl v5.26.1 built for x86\_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi, september 2017 \todo{Is this a problem? Should we perhaps bump this just incase it has anything to say for our results?}
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware Specifications}
\label{sec:hardwarespecs}
The host system used for running the experiments feature a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7600U CPU @ 2.80GHz processor and 24 GB memory. The processor features two physical cores, and is capable of running two threads per core. This means that the processor has a maximum of 4 logical cores.
